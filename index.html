          <h2 id="workExperience">Work Experience</h2>
          <p>Here is a <em>very</em> brief history of my work experience.</p>
          <p>I have worked in QA for <strong>a lot</strong> of software companies focused on K-12 assessment and evaluation.</p>
          <p>Most recently I was a <span class="contextByParent">Senior QA Engineer</span> for Amplify (formerly Wireless Generation), a division of News Corp. I worked for Intel-Assess until it was acquired by Wireless Generation. At both companies I worked on the Intel-Assess product. After the acquisition I also worked on the mClass:Beacon product suite.</p>
          <p>Wireless Generation made a huge bet on tablet-based instruction and assessment. The bet did not pay off and in late 2015 the decision was made to auction of the company's assets. I became the sole QA contributor for my products from September 2015 until August 2016.</p>
          <p>Before working at Intel-Assess I worked for Edusoft, a division of Riverside Publishing, a division of Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, a wholly owned subsidiary of Riverdeep Investments. Edusoft was an assessment management platform acquired by Houghton Mifflin and run into the ground by the witless application of publishing industry best practices to software development.</p>
          <h2 id="education">Education</h2>
          <p>Epicodus represents the most serious commitment I've made to my own education in over 20 years.</p>
          <p>Prior to coming to Epicodus my recent attempts at education have been fitful and abortive.</p>
          <p>In 1992 I matriculated at Tufts University. I had been accepted to the college of engineering but unfortunately I got scared that I was typecasting myself and transfered to the college of Liberal Arts. I really wish I had completed an engineering degree, but there is no sense grieving over the past.</p>
